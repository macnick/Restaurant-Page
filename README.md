# Restaurant Page

This is a project of the JavaScript curriculum at Microverse - @microverseinc.
In this project we create a reastaurant page. The objective is to dynamically render every page using Javascript DOM manipulation.

## Description
- This is a page with a fixed menu bar and a footer. 
- There are 3 menu choices: Home which is the default, Menu and Contact
- Each menu choice renders part of the page and inserts it into the DOM tree
- The page is fully responsive.
- In small sizes the menu is replaced by a burger which opens a sidenav with the same choices.
