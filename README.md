# Restaurant Page

This is a project of the JavaScript curriculum at Microverse - @microverseinc.
In this project, we have to create a restaurant page. The objective is to dynamically render every page using Javascript DOM manipulation.

## Description
- This is a page with a fixed menu bar and a footer. 
- There are 3 menu choices: Home which is the default, Menu, and Contact.
- Each menu choice renders part of the page and inserts it into the DOM tree.
- The page is fully responsive.
- In small sizes, the menu is replaced by a burger that opens a sidenav with the same choices.

## Screenshots
